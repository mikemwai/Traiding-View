# ecommerce
My first ecommerce website project that I created for an organization called eShopping. This project does not contain any frontend development framework such as bootstrap but uses html, css, php and javascript for its functionality.

## Prerequisites
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
- [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) 

## Usage

- After installation, open `Xampp`, open `phpmyadmin` in your brwoser, and create a new database `ecommerce1`.
- Import the [SQL file](./ecommerce.sql) in your `phpmyadmin`.
- Run the project:

```sh
  php -S localhost:8000/Homepage/home.php
```
