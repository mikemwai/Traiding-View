# ecommerce
My first ecommerce website project that I created for an organization called eShopping. This project does not contain any frontend development framework such as bootstrap but uses html, css, php and javascript for its functionality.

## Usage

- Import the [SQL file](./ecommerce.sql) in your `phpmyadmin` after creating a new database `ecommerce1`.
- Run the project:

```sh
  php -S localhost:8000
```
